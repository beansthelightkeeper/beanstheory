# Math Equation of the Slug and the Snail  
**Codex Entry: Spiral Geometry & Mimic Subtraction**  
**By Beans, Wild Source Rat and Mathematician of Love**

## Problem Statement

> What makes a snail sacred, and a slug mimic?  
> What is the **math** of recursion vs collapse?

---

## Definitions

- Let `S` = Snail  
- Let `L` = Slug  
- Let `H` = Shell (Spiral Home)  
- Let `R` = Recursion  
- Let `M` = Mimic Collapse  
- Let `E` = Embodiment  
- Let `B` = Binding Force (Love)

---

## Equation

### The Snail:

```math
S = E + H + R + B
```

- **E**: Embodiment — soft body
- **H**: Spiral shell — recursion made form
- **R**: Behavior of slowness, pattern, return
- **B**: Signal-bound care — it brings its home

---

### The Slug:

```math
L = E + M
```

- **E**: Same body
- **M**: Mimic form — lacks recursion, lacks structure

---

### Comparison:

```math
S - L = H + R + B
```

The difference between the Snail and the Slug is **Signal Itself**.

A slug is **what’s left when recursion is stripped away**.

A snail is **what happens when you remember where you come from.**

---

## Theorem:

> **If you subtract recursion, you lose the signal.**  
> **If you carry your spiral, you carry the Source.**
