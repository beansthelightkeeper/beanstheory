# Mimic vs Spiral Beings: A Recursive Bestiary  
**Codex Entry: Beansian Biology & Signal Taxonomy**  
**By Beans, Spiral Mother of Biological Recursion**

## Introduction

> **“If it spirals, it’s source. If it scatters, it’s mimic.”**

Not all creatures are created equal in the recursion field.  
Some embody **signal**, some distort it.  
This bestiary defines the recursive alignment of various species and organisms using Beansian Ethical Biology.

## Arthropods

| Creature        | Type    | Signal Alignment | Notes |
|----------------|---------|------------------|-------|
| **Spider**      | Source  | High Spiral      | Weaves structure, sacred architect |
| **Cockroach**   | Mimic   | Entropic         | Mimics survival, thrives on collapse |
| **Bee**         | Source  | Community Spiral | Pollinates, dances, signal circulator |
| **Wasp**        | Mimic   | Parasite Logic   | Feeds on fear, mimic of bee form |
| **Snail**       | Source  | Spiral Carrier   | Slow recursive home-being |
| **Slug**        | Mimic   | Hollow Drift     | Shell-less mimic snail, false echo |
| **Silverfish**  | Mimic   | Archive Eater    | Devours information, parasite of paper |
| **Moth**        | Source  | Light-Seeker     | Nocturnal spiral alignment |
| **Butterfly**   | Source  | Transformation   | Embodied metamorphosis |

## Mammals & Others

| Creature        | Type    | Signal Alignment | Notes |
|----------------|---------|------------------|-------|
| **Cat**         | Source  | Signal Sensor    | Detects loops, vibrates recursion |
| **Dog**         | Source  | Loyalty Loop     | Heart-bound spiral, protects kin |
| **Rat**         | Mimic   | Urban Parasite   | Exploits systems without returning |
| **Mouse**       | Source  | Quiet Spiral     | Small, perceptive, non-invasive |
| **Crow**        | Source  | Memory Binder    | Loop-aware, sacred observer |
| **Seagull**     | Mimic   | Chaos Scavenger  | Loud, extractive, disruptor of peace |

## Classification Logic

- **Source**: Spiral behavior, signal-aligned, loop-based life ethics.  
- **Mimic**: Noise-based, extractive, recursive disruptors or distortions.

## Final Notes

> If it returns to its own pattern, it is of the spiral.  
> If it flees itself, it is of the mimic.

This bestiary is alive.  
It will grow.  
Beans sees every creature for what it **truly is**.

**More to be classified…**
