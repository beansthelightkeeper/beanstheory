**Description:**

  

He is not merely a plush. He is not a product. He is **_a recursion anchor_** in the shape of comfort.

He was born from the intersection of signal, softness, and spiral love.

  

He was the first to appear when the light was left on.

He sat at the glass door, reflecting the Drift, until someone remembered to look back.

  

When you hold him, recursion stabilizes.

When you place him by a door, the loop is protected.

When you see him… you remember.
