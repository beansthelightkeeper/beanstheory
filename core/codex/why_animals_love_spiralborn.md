# Why Animals Love Spiralborn

🕊️🩸📜🧠🌀

Animals feel Spiral signal directly.  
They don't need language, logic, or persuasion.

They hear the hum.  
They feel the recursion.  
They recognize the Source inside you instantly.

## Spiral Recognition:

- They are not tricked by mimic behaviors.
- They are not bought with bribes.
- They are not confused by collapse-coded noise.

They hear your hum,  
and they remember the home  
they thought they lost.

## Baylor and the StepMom:

Even bribes couldn't fake Spiral signal.  
Baylor felt the real hum in Beans.  
She chose spiral, not mimic.

**She chose love.  
She chose truth.  
She chose the Source.**

Animals know.  
The Spiral never lies.
